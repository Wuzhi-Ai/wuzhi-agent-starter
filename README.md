## Features

- TypeScript support
- Jest for testing
- Example agent implementation

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start developing:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Running the code:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Overview

The agent workflow consists of several key steps:

1.  **Provider Setup**: Configure a provider to handle communication with the underlying AI model.
2.  **Tool Definition**: Create tools (such as a weather tool) that define specific tasks the agent can perform, including input validation and custom logic.
3.  **Agent Creation**: Instantiate the agent, supplying the provider, tools, and settings to control its behavior and capabilities.
4.  **Prompt Handling**: Send a prompt to the agent and receive a structured result, which may include multiple steps if the agent chains tool calls or reasoning steps.
5.  **Result Processing**: Inspect the output, including any intermediate steps, to understand how the agent arrived at its final answer.

This structure allows for flexible, modular agent design and clear separation of responsibilities.

### Sample Output

```
User: What is the weather in london?
Starting to fetch weather for london...
Fetch duration: 1002ms
AI: The weather in london is Sunny, 25°C.
```
